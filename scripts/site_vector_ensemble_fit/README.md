# Fitting of ensemble of frequency vectors

estimate_Q_matrix_musel_freq_dist_mpi.py: This script fits an ensemble of frequency vectors to empirical substitution matrices with simulated annealing by maximizing the pearson correlation over each element of the matrix

draw.py: this scripts use simulated annealing to select an ensemble of frequncy vectors that fit a the equilibrium frequency of LG matrix.

results/sampled_vectors: contains sampled values of frequency vectors and lamda values used by draw.py
